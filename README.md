# ScrapTF-Raffle-Bot
Automatically enters all open raffles utilizing Python's "Selenium" library.

Will probably become obsolete or will break in the near-future. Didn't plan on releasing it anyways.

***Using scripts like this CAN and WILL get you BANNED from http://scrap.tf/***

***Make sure the Selenium ChromeDriver (chromedriver.exe) is in the SAME DIRECTORY AS THE SCRIPT***

###How to use:
  1. Navigate to http://scrap.tf/
  2. Login to Scrap.TF using their Steam OpenID login.
  3. Fetch the required cookies from your browser.
  4. Paste the required cookies into the script under each required 'VALUE'. 
  5. Fire up the script and let it run fully. You will know when it is done.

Example of a good cookie: cf_uid = {'name' : '_cfduid', 'value' : 'RANDOMLYGENERATEDVALUEHERE', 'secure' : True}
